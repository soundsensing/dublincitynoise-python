# Python module for Dublin City Noise

[Dublin City Noise](https://dublincitynoise.com/) has a sensor network
with 12 sound-level sensor across the city. Most of the senors have been operating since 2012.
The project provides both [historical data](https://data.smartdublin.ie/dataset/noise_monitoring)
and an [API](http://dublincitynoise.sonitussystems.com/applications/api/api-doc.html).

This Python module provides easy and convenient access to these datasource.
It is intended to support research and development of data analytics for noise monitoring.
